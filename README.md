For the exchange endpoint which needs user to be authenticated before it can be used,there is an endpoint to create new user
after creating user, you need to pass your credentials to header before it can used to call the exchange endpoint

Moresore, this project was developed on linux and I used sqlite to store my user. so appropriate database path must given to DB_DATABSE in your database config

go to config folder then database.php

go to sqlite array...and change DB_DATABASE value to right path on the machine

more so...I use the same laravel application to create solution for both Task 1 and  2

I was unable to add test because of am in a tight schedule with current place of work...and due to timeline given.


Thanks
